<p align="center">
<b>Discover, analyze, and manage cryptographic assets across your infrastructure.<br>
Modern dashboard for risk, compliance, and quantum migration planning.</b>
</p>

## üöÄ Overview

Crypto Discovery is a modular Python system for scanning, inventorying, and managing cryptographic assets (certificates, SSH keys, code references) across your environment. It provides:

- **Automated asset discovery** (certs, SSH keys, code)
- **Risk scoring** (quantum vulnerability, deprecated/weak crypto)
- **Compliance analytics** (NIST PQC, deprecated usage)
- **Migration planning** (quantum-safe recommendations)
- **Modern web dashboard** for visualization and management

## üß© Features

- **Full cryptographic asset discovery**: Scans certificates, SSH keys, and code repositories for crypto usage.
- **Risk scoring**: Assesses each asset for quantum vulnerability, deprecated/weak algorithms, and urgency.
- **Compliance analytics**: NIST PQC readiness, deprecated usage, and actionable recommendations.
- **Migration planning**: Generates prioritized, actionable plans for quantum-safe upgrades.
- **Modern dashboard**: Interactive web UI (Flask + HTML/JS/CSS) for asset management, risk, compliance, and export.
- **API-first**: REST endpoints for integration and automation.
- **Export**: Download asset inventory as CSV.
- **Reset**: One-click reset of all scans/assets for fresh analysis.

## üìä Dashboard Preview

> _The dashboard provides real-time visibility into your cryptographic landscape:_

- Asset summary (by type, status, algorithm)
- Risk distribution (low/medium/high)
- Compliance percentage and issues
- Migration plan with priorities and timelines
- Asset table with search, filter, and export

## üõ†Ô∏è Quickstart

### 1. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the dashboard

```bash
python crypto_discovery.py --web
```

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

### 3. Run a scan

Click **"Run Scan"** in the dashboard, or use:

```bash
python crypto_discovery.py --scan
```

## üìö Documentation

- **Risk scoring**: Each asset is scored based on algorithm, key size, and quantum vulnerability. See code for details.
- **Compliance**: NIST PQC readiness, deprecated usage, and recommendations are calculated automatically.
- **Migration plan**: Prioritized by risk and asset type, with effort and timeline estimates.
- **Scheduler**: Daily automated scans (can be customized in code).
